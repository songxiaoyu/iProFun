Package: iProFun
Title: An integrative analysis tool to screen for Proteogenomic Functional traits perturbed by DNA alterations
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("Jiayi", "Ji", email = "Jiayi.Ji@mountsinai.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The goal of iProFun is to 1) characterize functional consequences of DNA alterations by providing the probabilities of different association patterns, 2) identify key genes whose DNA alterations preserve functional consequences on downstream molecules at FDR controlled error rate.
